Checked Possibilities:
- Different spectra from NIS
- Different transmittance
- spherical albedo
- Path radiance
- mu

- Problem seems to be with asd reference spectrum, unsure what


FOUND ERRORS
- was resampling to neon_wvl instead of just truncating to the correct indices,
    replaced:
      spectrum = super_resample(...)
    with:
      spectrum = obs['spectra'][n,0:152]
- I verified that after the above fix the mean reflectance values were the same
  between python and matlab/octave
- plot_results() was already taking the averages, fixed so it will plot
  averages without affecting subsequent code
- Added averaging to calc_rmse() to exactly replicate matlab function
