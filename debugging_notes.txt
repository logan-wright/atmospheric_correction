Checked Possibilities:
- Different spectra from NIS
- Different transmittance
- spherical albedo
- Path radiance
- mu

FOUND ERRORS
- was resampling to neon_wvl instead of just truncating to the correct indices,
    replaced:
      spectrum = super_resample(...)
    with:
      spectrum = obs['spectra'][n,0:152]
